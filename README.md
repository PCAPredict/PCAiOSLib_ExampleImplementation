# PCAiOSLib_ExampleImplementation

## Introduction

This iOS project is a basic example of how to implement the [PCAiOSLib Cocoapod](https://cocoapods.org/pods/PCAiOSLib), which is an easy way to implement PCA Predict's type ahead search technology in an iOS application. 

Please note you will need to register with either [PCA Predict](http://www.pcapredict.com "PCA Predict") or [Addressy](https://www.addressy.com "Addressy") for a license key, to be able to use this example.
